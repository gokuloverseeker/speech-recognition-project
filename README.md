Speech Recognition Project: Because Talking to Machines is Now a Thing
Welcome, brave soul, to the wild world of speech recognition with the Whisper model! This project is your ticket to transcribing audio files with a dash of sarcasm and a sprinkle of tech magic. Buckle up, because we’re about to make your computer listen to you—whether it wants to or not!
🎉 What This Does

Transcribes your audio files (e.g., .wav) into text with a fancy GUI-like upload feature.
Saves the transcript and segment details because, hey, who doesn’t love CSV files?
Supports multiple languages (if you can figure out the codes—good luck!).

🚨 Requirements (Yes, You Need These)

Python 3.x: Because Python 2 is so 2019. Install it if you haven’t—cry if you must.
Whisper: Grab it from pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git. Don’t blame me if it breaks your internet.
ffmpeg: Install with apt install ffmpeg on Linux/Colab, or figure it out yourself on other OSes. We’re not holding your hand here.
pandas: pip install pandas—because spreadsheets are cool, right?
Google Colab: Run this masterpiece in Colab because your local machine probably can’t handle it (kidding… maybe).

🎬 How to Run This Mess (a.k.a. main.py)

Clone the Repo: git clone https://github.com/gokuloverseeker/speech-recognition-project.git. Yes, you need Git—Google it.
Open in Colab: Upload the folder to Colab or mount your Google Drive (from google.colab import drive; drive.mount('/content/drive')).
Install Dependencies: Run !pip install -q git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git and !apt install -y ffmpeg in a cell. Pray it works.
Run the Script: Execute !python main.py after navigating to the project folder (%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/Colab\ Notebooks/project).
Upload Audio: Click the upload button, pick a language code (e.g., 'ta' for Tamil, 'en' for English), and watch the magic (or errors) happen.
Download Results: Grab the .txt and .csv files like they’re hotcakes.

😂 Pro Tips (Because We Care… Sort Of)

If it crashes, blame the Whisper model—not me. It’s AI; it should know better.
Test with short audio files first. Your 3-hour podcast might make Colab cry.
Edit this README.md if you’re feeling fancy—add your own sarcastic flair!
